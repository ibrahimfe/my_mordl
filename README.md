# My Mordl

## Introduction

my_mordl is a Python project that provides a clone of the popular word game by the New York Times. In this game, the player is presented with a five-letter word, and the objective is to guess the word based on the available letters. The difference between this project and the original game is that this project uses a custom dictionary.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from Github:

'''$ git clone https://github.com/ibrahimfe/my_mordl.git'''

2. Install the required dependencies:

'''$ pip install rich random contextlib'''

## Usage

To play my_mordl, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:

'''$ python my_mordl.py'''

The game will start, and you will be presented with a five-letter word scrambled in a random order. You must guess the original word based on the available letters. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, and each incorrect guess will reduce the number of attempts remaining.

The output of the game will be colorful, thanks to the rich library.

## Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the words.txt file, which contains the dictionary of words used in the game. You can add, remove or modify words in this file to suit your preference.
